# Logos

This folder contains the source logos for the API.

## Formats

- Supported formats are png, jpeg and svg.
  - Note on svg: for optimal results, the intrinsic size of the svg should be at least 300x300 px.
- Images are converted to pngs with longest side 300px, with support for transparency.

## Others

Images in the `other` folder are various logos that are currently not in the API, but still useful
to retain, such as
- variations of existing logos
- logos of associations that are no longer active
